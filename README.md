# BigInt

Implementing large modulo arithmetic and a calculator allows to compose more compound mathematical expressions from basic operations.

Specific features:
* Modulo value is provided at compile time.
* This project could be used in cryptographic applications that require large modulo arithmetic.
* Calculator supports such operations:
	* \+
	* \-
	* \*
	* /
	* ^
	* grouping with "()"
